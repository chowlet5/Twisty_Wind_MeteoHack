This is Twisty Wind's submission for the Meteo Hack-A-Thon

The files here contain the python script for running audio using the Environment and Climate Change Canada data for a given site
based on the wind speeds, mean temperature, rain and snow. The script runs through extracting the data and manipulating the sounds
based on the extracted data.

By altering the province and station, different data sets will be used for to generate the music.
